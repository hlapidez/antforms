<h2>Ackowledgements</h2>
<p>Many thanks to Jasper Verweij and his trusty anonymous colleague for their 
countless change requests and constructive criticism that have made this piece 
of software into something usable!</p>
<p>Additional thanks to Jasper for pointing out that I had mispelled "colleague"
in the previous pararaph.</p>
<p>Thank you Patrick Martin for your endless list of bugs I never dreamt were possible on such a
small, ignominious, negligible, mostly harmless app. May your efforts be rewarded with
many-a-promotion wherever it is you're pulling your hair out of your head even as we speak.</p>
