<h2>AntForm documentation</h2>
<h3>Changing the look and feel</h3>
<p>The look and feel of AntForm and AntMenu tasks is not set by default [<i>Note:
up to and including version 1.4, the look and feel was the native look and feel
found on the underlying platform</i>]. To change the look and feel, the LAF
class name can be attributed to an AntForm or AntMenu task, and subsequent tasks
will reuse the look and feel so long as it is not set again.</p>
<p>A reminder: to set the default look and feel for any swing app launched via
Ant, you can add it to the ant options as so:</p>
<code>export ANT_OPTS=-Dswing.defaultlaf=&lt;Java L&amp;F clas  name&gt;</code>
<p>...And launch Ant with a pointer to the lib directory containing the L&amp;F jar
file:</p>
<code>ant -lib &lt;your lib directory with the LAF jar file&gt; -f &lt;build
	file&gt;...</code>
<p>To consistently use a spécific look &amp; feel, consider writing a simple
script to launch your ant scripts. For instance, to user the windows look &amp;
feel, the following batch file will do the trick:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
set ANT_OPTS=-Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.windows.WindowsLookAndFeel
ant -f test.xml %1
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Implementing wizard behaviour</h3>
<p>Originally, the AntForm task was intended to provide forms in Ant the way
HTML forms did it for websites, e.g. with a validation button and a reset
button. Given the need for rapid development of wizard-like interfaces, i.e.
multiple steps with a form for each step and possibility of going back and
forth, the <code>nextTarget</code> and <code>previousTarget</code> attributes
were added to AntForm. When set, these links activate the named targets on the
current Ant process.</p>

<h3>When to use AntForm? When to use AntMenu?</h3>
<p>Use an <code>AntForm</code> when there's a possibility of validating data on
the current screen. If the current screen is just a pointer to other screens,
then use an <code>AntMenu</code>. <code>AntForm</code> screens need not undergo
form submission each time they are shown: <code>AntMenuItem</code> and
<code>LinkBar</code> types are two ways of adding link behaviour to the form.</p>

<h3>Adding menus to forms</h3>
<p>The AntMenu task provides a simple menu through it's <code>link</code>
properties : no hierarchy and a single list. If your needs concern multiple, hierarchal menus, 
you can bind menu items that link to other targets through the
<code>AntMenuItem</code> type. This type is available to both
<code>AntForm</code> and <code>AntMenu</code> tasks. For example, it's very
practical to use in your entry-point gui, where you might have an
<code>AntMenu</code> with a few labels and a few menus that link to all the
tasks your script hosts.</p>

<p><code>AntMenuItem</code> items can be added to other <code>AntMenuItem</code>
items, and the first one in a hierachy need not have a target, as it points to
other menu items. Here is a simple usage example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
		&lt;antform title="AntForm menu test"&gt;
			&lt;AntMenuItem name="Other targets"&gt;
				&lt;AntMenuItem name="Launch echo 1 task" target="echo1"/&gt;
				&lt;AntMenuItem name="Launch echo 2 ask" target="echo2"/&gt;
			&lt;/AntMenuItem&gt;				
			&lt;AntMenuItem name="Wizard targets"&gt;
				&lt;AntMenuItem name="Launch wizard1 task"
					target="wizard1"/&gt;
				&lt;AntMenuItem name="Launch wizard 3"
					target="wizard3"/&gt;
			&lt;/AntMenuItem&gt;				
			&lt;label&gt;This is a test with an inner menu&lt;/label&gt;
		&lt;/antform&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>Adding links to forms</h3>
<p>If you need to add link behaviour to your form, i.e. the possibility of
skipping to a named target without validating the form, you must first add a
<code>LinkBar</code> to your form, in which the <code>link</code> types can then 
be nested. Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;antform stylesheet="style.test" okMessage="OK" focus="OK"
	title="Linkbar test"&gt;
	&lt;label&gt;Choose a result, or go to other results screen&lt;/label&gt;
	&lt;radioSelectionProperty label="Results: " property="res"
		values="1,2,3"/&gt;			
	&lt;linkBar&gt;
		&lt;link label="Previous 3 results"
			target="echo1"/&gt;
		&lt;link label="Next 3 results" target="echo2"/&gt;
	&lt;/linkBar&gt;
&lt;/antform&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<h3>About immutable properties</h3>
<p>Ant properties are specified as immutable, that is to say that once a property has been set in
an Ant process it cannot be set anew within the same process. This means that you can set
properties in your build file just once. It is additionally recommended that you set the properties for the entire build at the start of your build file, because AntMenu doesn't handle interspersed property tags very well.</p>
<h3>Form validation</h3>
<p>Currently, the only validation that the AntForm task does is to require
certain property values to be non null. In this way, a <code>required</code>
attribute can be set to the <code>TextProperty</code>,
<code>MultilineTextProperty</code>, <code>DateProperty</code> and
<code>FileSelectionProperty</code> properties. If any property is set to
<code>required</code>, the form will not submit until the property value is 
set by its associated widget.</p>

<h3>Persistent properties</h3>
<p>Properties set via an AntForm task can be persisted to a file by the
<code>save</code> attribute. This way, they can be reused in another process at  
a later time, provided that the properties file thus saved are loaded through the Ant
<code>property</code> instruction. </p>

<h3>Automatic keyboard mnemonics</h3>
<p>AntForm and AntMenu tasks will automatically choose mnemonic shortcuts for
properties and buttons. This translates into labels and buttons having certain
letters underlined that can be activated by an <code>ALT-[letter]</code> sequence
on most operating systems. When activating a button, the button will
automatically validate, whereas other properties will only grab the window
focus. The mnemonic character used for each widget will be the first letter of the widget label if
it has not allready been used in the form, then on to the next letter and so on 
iteratively until a letter has been found that hasn't allready been used in the form.
</p>
<p>Certain problems can arise given the look and feel used. For instance,
running on Windows XP will not show the mnemonics on the labels, only on the
buttons when the <code>ALT</code> key is being held down.</p>

<h3>Window size</h3>
<p>A new window is created for each call to an AntForm or AntMenu task. If the
<code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are omitted, the new window 
will pack into the least amount of space required to show all the widgets
contained within itself. Also, the window will automatically center on the
screen on the basis of its width and height. In this way, the use experience
can be confusing with what appears to be a single window changing size after
each validation. To prevent this, <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
attributes can be set to each AntMenu and AntForm task with the same values, 
thus homogenizing the resulting interface.</p>

<h3>Conditional widgets</h3>
<p>All widgets associated to AntForm or AntMenu tasks support conditional existence. If you
require a widget to be shown if a specified property is set in the project properties
table, use the <code>if</code> attribute. For the opposite behaviour, use the <code>unless</code>
attribute.</p>
