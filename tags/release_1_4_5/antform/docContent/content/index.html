<h2>About AntForm/AntMenu</h2>
<p>AntForm is a java application designed to add form interaction to Ant scripts. Ant is a java-based build tool 
(see website: <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>) extensively used in the java world to 
automate system-level tasks. Ant contains a large number of tasks that can be
used together to leverage the possibilities of the java platform in an easy way.
Though Ant has an input task, user-based input is by default constrained to the
console window and properties values are provided one at a time.</p>
<p>The goal of the AntForm project is to provide a simple <b>GUI</b> providing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Input forms for modifying properties</li>
	<li>Button-based menus that launch ant targets</li>
</ul>

<h2>What AntForm does</h2>
<p>AntForm provides an Ant task (see <a href="usageaf.html">usage</a>) for
setting property values through a Swing-based form. Properties are presented
with a label on the left column and a widget field in the right column, one property
per line. Each field component modifies an appointed Ant property when the form is
submitted (i.e. the <code>ok</code> button clicked). Properties thus modified can
be saved to a specified properties file and/or reused in other tasks. See <a href="screenshots.html#antform">screenshot</a></p>
<h2>What AntMenu does</h2>
<p>AntMenu provides an Ant task (see <a href="usageam.html">usage</a>) that sets
up a menu in a single vertical column for launching other ant targets. Each link to
an Ant target is enabled by a button. See <a href="screenshots.html#antmenu">screenshot</a></p>
