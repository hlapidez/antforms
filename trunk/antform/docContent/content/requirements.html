<h2>Requirements</h2>
     <p>
      To be able to run Blogoommer you'll need a java environment, version 1.4 
      or later.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't have java, you can download and install the software from 
      the official website: <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com.</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of hardware, it would be safe to say that a machine bearing 
      over 128 Megs of RAM with a processor concomittant with that (&gt;= 1 GHz) 
      should enable you to get the job done. The user interface is lacking in 
      terms of reponse on Mac OS X - this is a drawback of Swing on the Mac 
      (you should know that the interface is developped using Java Swing 
      components).
    </p>
    <p>

      Lastly, you need to have access your an FTP/Web site. This requirement 
      is not optional, since you can still generate your blog files but will 
      have no official place to upload them to without a proper remote FTP 
      site that hosts web pages.
