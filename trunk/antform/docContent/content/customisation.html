<h2>Customizing your generated website</h2>
<p>Note: this section is for advanced users with a bit of experience in web
	    development.</p>

<p>Blogoommer renders your website using an HTML template 
and associated css stylesheet. When you publish your 
weblog, an HTML file is generated for each month 
containing weblog entries and another one for your 
website index file. These files are placed in a 
directory created at the same place your weblog is 
saved, the directory having the same name as the 
weblog file only suffixed with &quot;-site&quot;. All of the 
generated HTML files are placed in this directory, 
along with the rss news feeds and a css stylesheet. </p>

<p>If you want to change the colors, fonts, margins, 
padding space, border properties, etc. of your 
website, you can modify the css stylesheet, 
named <code>style.css</code>. </p>

<p>Once generated, this file will never be overwritten,
so you don't need to fear losing your customization 
the next time you publish your weblog.</p>
<p>The same holds  true for the HTML template, 
<code>layout.template.html</code>,  which you can modify at will 
to suit your tastes  in how the information is presented on 
your website.  The files are ported to your remote FTP 
site during publication.
