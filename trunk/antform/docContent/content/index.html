<h2>About Blogoommer</h2>
<p>
      Blogoommer is a standalone blogging application for people who want to 
      manage their blogs independently of any weblog hostiong service. 
      All it takes is a remote FTP/Web site to upload your blogs to. Such 
      sites are frequent, many of them free of charge. In many cases, your 
      internet provider provides online storage space for hosting your personal
      web pages that you can access through FTP for editing your site.
    </p>
    <p>
    Blogoommer will handle rendering your weblog to HTML, 
      porting files to the remote server and maintain a coherent website with a 
      calendar component for easy navigation to:</p>
      <ul>
	      <li>your current blogs</li>
	      <li>a list of  archives for past months</li>
	      <li>a list of recent blogs.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      The other main feature of Blogommer is that it generates RSS news feeds 
      from your recent blogs list. People with RSS readers such as the 
      Thunderbird mail client, Firebird web browser, etc can get the news 
      feed from the links associated to the weblog site and get headlines 
      from your latest blogs automatically that link to the site, 
      without you having to maintain a list of emails as in discussion groups or
      mailing lists.
