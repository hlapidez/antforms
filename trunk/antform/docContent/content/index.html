<h2>About AntForm/AntMenu</h2>
<p>AntForm is a java tool designed to add interaction to Ant scripts through graphical forms.
If you're new to Ant, start at the Ant site (see website: <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">http://ant.apache.org/</a>). Ant is used extensively used in the java world to automate system-level tasks, mostly (but not exclusively) as a software build system.</p>
<h2>Why use AntForm?</h2>
<p>Because automation can only be pushed so far until user input is required, the Ant developper will
resort to prompting the user for certain property values at runtime. When the number of these properties 
increases and certain property values become dependant on others, it makes sense to divide the input into
a flow of forms. AntForm enables you to do this.</p>
<p>In short, in keeping with the natural evolution of console-to-gui at the language level, 
AntForm ushers in the <i>present-form</i> paradigm where a <i>read value</i> view existed before.</p>

<p>The goal of the AntForm project is to provide a simple <b>GUI</b> that provides the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Input forms for modifying properties</li>
	<li>Button-based menus that launch ant targets</li>
</ul>

<h2>What AntForm does</h2>
<p>AntForm provides an Ant task (see <a href="usageaf.html">usage</a>) for
setting property values through a Swing-based form. Properties are presented
with a label on the left column and a widget field in the right column, one property
per line. Each field component modifies an appointed Ant property when the form is
submitted (i.e. the <code>ok</code> button clicked). Properties thus modified can
be saved to a specified properties file and/or reused in other tasks. See <a href="screenshots.html#antform">screenshot</a></p>
<h2>What AntMenu does</h2>
<p>AntMenu provides an Ant task (see <a href="usageam.html">usage</a>) that sets
up a menu in a single vertical column for launching other ant targets. Each link to
an Ant target is enabled by a button. See <a href="screenshots.html#antmenu">screenshot</a></p>
