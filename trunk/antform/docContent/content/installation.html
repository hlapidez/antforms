<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Blogoommer comes bundled as either a zip file or a Windows setup executable. On a windows
platform, the latter os preferable as it has an executable launcher and creates links to the
executable in your programs menu. However, on Unix, Linux or Mac you will need to use the zip
file which, once extracted, contained a blogoomer.sh script that launches the application.</p>
<p>In all cases, as specified in the requirements page, Java needs to be installed on your computer 
before Blogoommer can be used.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
      The following is a step by step instruction manual for creating your 
      weblog and adding blogs to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Note: in Blogoommer, a weblog is a collection of blog entries. Hence 
      the use of both terms in the documentation and the application menus, 
      because they mean different things.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>1. Enter your site's meta-information</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      a. Site title
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter a title that reflects what your site stands (or sleeps) for. Keep 
      it curt and to the point: this is the information that will head each 
      webpage in big, bold letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      b. Site summary
    </p>
    <p>
      A concise summary of what your site is going to provide meaning-wise. 
      This information will map to each site page sub-header.
    </p>
    <p>

      <b>2. Configure one or more remote servers.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Configuring a remote server is the next big step. All weblogs must be 
      associated to a remote server, since there's no use writing blogs if 
      there's nowhere to blog to. You enter the following information:
    </p>
    <p>
      address: the internet FTP address of the remote site. It should be given 
      to you by the web host with whom you have an account (e.g. <i>
      ftp.somewhere.com</i>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Login: your login to the remote FTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Password: your password to the remote FTP server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remote directory: the base path where to blog to following the FTP 
      connection. Choose the root <i>/</i> if you want to blog directly to the 
      home of your web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>3. Write blogs</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      From the blog pane, click the &quot;New&quot; option. From there, the application 
      will open the blog editor. You type in a title, a summary and some 
      content. The summary will be available to rss subscribers, whereas the 
      content will go directly into the site pages. Once finished, You either 
      save the blog, or update it if it's an exising blog. The difference 
      between <i>save</i> and <i>update</i> concerns the blog date: the blog's 
      date is only updated when using the <i>update</i> action.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>5. Publish</b>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      You need to manually synchronize with the server to get your site up and 
      running. That is to say, you have to tell the application to send the 
      locally generated website modifications to the remote site by FTP. To do 
      this, select the <i>Actions -&gt; Publish </i>menu item. A pop-up will 
      come up showing you the progress of the file transfer. Be patient! As 
      the files are going over the network, this can take a certain time.
    </p>
    <p>

      <b>6. Archive your blogs</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is done for you. Blogommer organizes blogs per month. Each month 
      corresponds to an archive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>7. Trash your blogs.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing needs to be final.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you remove a blog, it will disappear from the site next time you 
      publish.
    </p>
